# File-Sharing-Portal
System Software Project for sharing files between users.

##Common setup problems and fixes
1. failed to open stream: Permission denied 
   make apache owner of the directory that is used for file uploading
2. zip archive class not found error
   enable zip class by adding extension=zip.so in php.ini under apache folder and restart apache.
##Note
Fetaures are possible to be broken as i uploaded the code after a long time of creation. 
If i get time i will sync everything till then it is good to through code first than the output.
